<p>CV available upon request.</p>
<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>I am a research scientist at IBM Quantum, focusing on design and analysis of quantum simulation algorithms for physical systems. I received my Ph.D. in Physics in 2023 from Tufts University, where I worked in Peter Loveâ€™s quantum computation group, also focusing on quantum simulation, funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the STAQ collaboration (also courtesy of NSF). In the summers of 2021 and 2022, I worked as a research intern at IBM Quantum. In January of 2022, I designed and taught PHYS 14 Programming Quantum Computers at Williams College for winter study (January term). Previously, I received my B.A. in physics from Williams College in 2017. At Williams, I conducted research with Charlie Doret and Bill Wootters, before completing a senior research thesis with Frederick Strauch. In 2017-2018 I conducted research with Shelby Kimmel of Middlebury College on methods for calibrating quantum gate sets.</p>
<p>In addition to physics, I enjoy birdwatching, exploring new natural places, and running with my dog.</p>
